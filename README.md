# Challenge Project: Appointment Planner

OVERVIEW:

This a React project and contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project Iâ€™ll be building.
This is a codecademy project in the front-end engineer path.

I will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

I will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks.

This README will be updated once this project is complete.
